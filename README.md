# sofwerx_deepfake
This is the github repository for the deepfake project for sofwerx data science interns
In this repo, we are trying to recreate karanvivekbhargavaâ€™s obamanet repo (https://github.com/karanvivekbhargava/obamanet) with a different person to better understand how to train the algorithm, and, therefore, learn how to detect when deepfake is being used.

Specifically, we will be using Vsauce videos on youtube to extract the training videos and convert to frames to test the algorithm and train the model. Please found the orginal video on Youtube here:https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce

Due to the limitation of files that Github can post, we only include several folders for video frames that we used and more data frames can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZnasC89hGGoubKyOL-FD5SS46JaNLPU1 (data.zip)
